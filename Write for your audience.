You are an expert in your field, your subscribers probably are not.

This means that you must explain everything in layman's terms and 
explain any industry terms, abbreviations and acronyms.

We all get used our industry terms and we often forget that others 
don't automatically understand them too. So be careful and proof 
read your newsletters looking for any assumed understanding and explain it better.
